# About me

I just completed my PhD in English at Stanford; starting October 1st I will be Junior Research Fellow at King's College, Cambridge. My ~~dissertation~~ book project, _Abstraction: A Literary History_, employs methods of both close and distant reading to explore three literary forms of abstract language: “abstract style,” in the syntactic symmetries and semantic formulae of the periodical essay; “abstract persons,” in the personified abstractions of the mid-century ode; and “abstract realism,” in the “tell, don’t show” narration of the early realist novel. I argue that each of these literary forms of abstraction arises as a formal solution to, paradoxically, a materialist problem of representation, one brought on by the increasingly impenetrable dynamics within the social and material relations of early capitalism. I also work on computational poetics and historical prosody, “keywords” and computational semantics, as well as the theory and methods of the digital humanities more broadly. I am a member of the Stanford Literary Lab, and served as its Associate Research Director from 2011 to 2015. You can also find me on Twitter, on Github, or by email at [heuser@stanford.edu](mailto:heuser@stanford.edu).
