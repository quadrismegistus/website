# About me

I am a Junior Research Fellow at King's College, Cambridge. My work  brings computational methods of text analysis to the study of literature and its history. I received my PhD in English from Stanford University, where I was a founding member of the Stanford Literary Lab and its longtime Associate Research Director.

My first book project, _Abstraction: A Literary History_, traces a slow-moving rise and fall in abstract language across centuries of literary history. Mixing close and distant reading, the book uncovers how these changes in literary semantics mediate changes in social organization. I focus on three literary forms of abstract language: “abstract style,” in the syntactic symmetries and semantic formulae of the periodical essay; “abstract persons,” in the personified abstractions of the mid-century ode; and “abstract realism,” in the “tell, don’t show” narration of the early realist novel. I argue that each of these literary forms of abstraction arises as a formal solution to a materialist problem of representation brought on by the increasingly impenetrable dynamics within the social and material relations of early capitalism. Through this literary history and computational framework, the book also aims to recuperate abstraction as both a method and an object of literary study. After all, in our present age of deindustrialized, immaterial, or “cognitive” capitalism, the realities of abstraction can no longer be ignored.

I am beginning work on a second book project: _Key Data_, an edited collection of essays in historical semantics. Alluding to Raymond Williams’ pathbreaking book, _Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society_ (1976), _Key Data_ carries forward the goals of Williams’ semantic histories while also altering their scale and methods. With new methods of computational semantics, the book traces the changing associations of words across historical corpora.

I also work on computational poetics and historical prosody, literary geography, “keywords” and computational semantics, and the theory and methods of the digital humanities more broadly. I am a member of the Stanford Literary Lab, and served as its Associate Research Director from 2011 to 2015.
