## Keydata Project

I am directing a new collaborative digital humanities project based working at the intersection of computational semantics and conceptual historyâ€”the title alluding to Raymond Williams' classic 1976 text, <i>Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society.</i> Co-directed with Pete de Bolla, Prof. of English there, and bringing together linguists, computer scientists, literary scholars, historians of political thought, and others, to join in a shared knowledge project.
