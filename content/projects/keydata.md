# Keydata Project

I am directing a new collaborative digital humanities project based working at the intersection of computational semantics and conceptual history—the title alluding to Raymond Williams' classic 1976 text, <i>Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society.</i> Co-directed with Pete de Bolla, Prof. of English there, and bringing together linguists, computer scientists, literary scholars, historians of political thought, and others, to join in a shared project in digital knowledge. Based in Cambridge, the project is also open to virtual collaboration (as, indeed, everything now is)—do get in touch if you have.
