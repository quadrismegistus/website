<h2><a href="/assets/talks/kingscollege2020" target="_blank">“Abstraction: A Literary History”</a></h2>

Talk given to King's College, Cambridge on February 18th, 2020, meant to introduce my work to the College and explain how it addresses the concept of “immateriality,” the official topic of my Junior Research Fellowship. The talk is a summary of my dissertation work on “abstract realism” and the novel.
